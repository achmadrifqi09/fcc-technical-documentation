                    To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                    JavaScript
                    code:
                </p>
                <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                    greetMe("World");

                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables,
                    called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                    Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

            <header>Declaring Variable</header>
            <article>
                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                <p>With the keyword var. For example :</p>
                <code>var x = 42;</code>
                This syntax can be used declare both local and global variables.
                <p>By simpli assigning it value. For example :</p>
                <code>x = 42;</code>
                This always declare a global variables. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't thi
                variant.
                <p>With the keyword let. For example :</p>
                <code>
                    let y = 13;
                </code>
                This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.See variable scope below.

            <article>
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it
                    is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a
                    function, it is ca</p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable
                    declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides
                    within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or
                    global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if
                    statement.
                </p>
                <code>
                    if (true) {var x = 5;} console.log(x);
                </code>
                This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced ECMAScript 2015.

            <header>Global Variable</header>
            <article>
                <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is
                    window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another
                    window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called
                    phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
                    parent.phoneNumber.

            <header>Data Type</header>
            <article>
                Six data types that are primitive:
                <ul>
                    <li>Boolean (true adn false)</li>
                    <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is
                        not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                    <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                    <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                    <li>String ("hello world")</li>
                    <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful
                    functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in
                    the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
                    procedures that your application can perform.</p>
